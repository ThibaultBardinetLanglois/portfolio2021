                        Iâ€™m a full-stack junior developer living in the Parisian suburbs and searching for a full time position in 2021.

                        My training focused on php and the Symfony framework. I then learned to use React with Express in order
                        to adapt myself to the most used technologies on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        React was a big revelation for me and I want to progress as much as possible with this library then also use 
                        Vue.js which is a rising technology at the moment.
                    </p>

                        I like to conceptualize and develop ergonomic interfaces with a clean and modern design, for that Sass and Figma are my 
                        friend.
